      </header>

      <div className="prose">
        <h2>1. Usefulness beats novelty</h2>
        <p>We are not interested in being first. We are interested in being right, durable, and applicable.</p>
        <p>A good article should still make sense after:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the tool changes</li>
          <li>the org restructures</li>
          <li>the trend cycle collapses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the value expires with the headline, it’s not value.</p>

        <h2>2. Clarity over cleverness</h2>
        <p>We do not reward:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>jargon</li>
          <li>academic fog</li>
          <li>“thought leadership” voice</li>
          <li>performative certainty</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do reward:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>plain language</li>
          <li>structured thinking</li>
          <li>explicit assumptions</li>
          <li>clear boundaries of what is known vs. unknown</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If something is complex, say so. If something is uncertain, say that too.</p>

        <h2>3. Grounded in real work</h2>
        <p>Every piece should connect to situations designers actually face:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>incomplete information</li>
          <li>political constraints</li>
          <li>time pressure</li>
          <li>legal, accessibility, or technical limits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hypotheticals are fine. Fantasy workflows are not.</p>
        <p>
          If the advice only works in a perfectly resourced org with infinite buy-in, it belongs somewhere else.
        </p>

        <h2>4. No false confidence</h2>
        <p>We avoid content that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>pretends there is a single correct answer</li>
          <li>over-promises outcomes</li>
          <li>frames design as persuasion theater</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Good design work is probabilistic. Good writing should acknowledge tradeoffs, not hide them.</p>
        <p>Confidence comes from reasoning, not tone.</p>

        <h2>5. Critique the work, not the people</h2>
        <p>We analyze:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>decisions</li>
          <li>systems</li>
          <li>incentives</li>
          <li>outcomes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not dunk on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>junior designers</li>
          <li>unnamed stakeholders</li>
          <li>straw-man teams</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This journal exists to sharpen judgment, not ego.</p>

        <h2>6. AI is treated as a tool, not a miracle</h2>
        <p>We publish writing about AI when it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>clarifies thinking</li>
          <li>exposes blind spots</li>
          <li>improves decision quality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not publish:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>demo-driven hype</li>
          <li>replacement fantasies</li>
          <li>claims detached from real workflows</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          AI does not make design better by default. It makes mistakes faster unless guided by judgment.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Fewer words. More signal.</h2>
        <p>Length is earned, not assumed.</p>
        <p>Articles should be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>structured</li>
          <li>scannable</li>
          <li>edited aggressively</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a paragraph exists only to sound smart, it gets cut.</p>
        <p>If a sentence can be shorter without losing meaning, it should be.</p>

        <h2>Editorial Notes for Contributors</h2>
        <p>Before submitting, ask yourself:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What decision does this help a designer make?</li>
          <li>What risk does this reduce?</li>
          <li>What assumption does this challenge?</li>
          <li>Where might this advice fail?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you can’t answer those without hedging, keep working.</p>

        <h2>What We Don’t Publish</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Trend summaries without analysis</li>
          <li>Tool tutorials disguised as insight</li>
          <li>Career advice that ignores power dynamics</li>
          <li>“Inspiration” without application</li>
          <li>Content written to impress other designers instead of help them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are plenty of places for that already.</p>

        <h2>Our Promise to Readers</h2>
        <p>If something is published here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>it was edited</li>
          <li>it was questioned</li>
          <li>it was stress-tested against real scenarios</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your time matters. We act like it.</p>
